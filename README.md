### 4\. Environment Variables

This project requires two `.env` files for configuration: one for the frontend and one for the backend.

#### Frontend (`.env` file in the root directory):

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Firebase client-side keys and the backend API URL.

```
# Firebase Client-Side Keys
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_firebase_api_key"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your_firebase_auth_domain"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_firebase_project_id"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your_firebase_storage_bucket"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_firebase_messaging_sender_id"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your_firebase_app_id"

# Backend API URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"

# Stripe
VITE_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK="your_stripe_payment_link"
```

#### Backend (`.env` file inside the `src/backend` directory):

Create a file named `.env` inside `src/backend` and add your secret keys and database connection string.

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:5173"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"

# Firebase Admin SDK (Service Account)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_firebase_project_id"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="your_firebase_client_email"
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your_firebase_private_key"

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret_key"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_stripe_webhook_secret"

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"

# SendGrid (for emails)
SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_sendgrid_api_key"
FROM_EMAIL="your_verified_sender_email"
```

### 5\. Database Setup

Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run the schema script to create all the necessary tables.

```sql
-- file: src/backend/database.sql
-- (Execute the contents of this file in your database client)
```

### 6\. Run the Application

You can start both the frontend development server and the backend server concurrently.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running\!

  * **Frontend:** `http://localhost:5173`
  * **Backend API:** `http://localhost:5000`
