# StudiumHub

**StudiumHub** turns static course materials (PDFs, slide decks, textbooks) into **interactive, AI-powered courses** that teachers can publish to their classes in minutes. It’s a teacher-first, student-friendly platform that goes far beyond “chat with PDF”: upload once → auto-generate **modules, lessons, quizzes, flashcards, and weekly review packs** → publish to students → track understanding with **real-time analytics**.

## What StudiumHub Delivers

### For Teachers

* **Upload → Course in minutes**
  Drop in a syllabus, slides, or a chapter PDF. StudiumHub automatically proposes **modules and lessons**, each with:

  * **Teach**: concise, cite-backed summaries and key terms
  * **Practice**: auto-generated quizzes (MCQ/TF/short) with explanations
  * **Review**: flashcards (spaced-repetition ready)
  * *(Optional wrappers)* **Warm-up**, **Apply task**, **Exit ticket**
* **One-click publishing to a class**
  Share a link or invite a roster. Every student receives the interactive version immediately.
* **Actionable analytics**
  See completion rates, average scores, high-friction concepts, and time-on-task—by student, lesson, and module.
* **Time saved, quality up**
  Replace hours of prep with AI-assisted structuring, while retaining full edit control.

### For Students

* **Guided, step-by-step lessons**
  Clear progress through Warm-up → Teach → Practice → Apply → Review → Exit, with a progress bar and gentle pacing.
* **Context-aware AI Tutor**
  Ask questions in a side panel scoped to the current lesson’s sources, with **citations to the original pages**.
* **Spaced review that just happens**
  Automatic weekly review packs combine missed questions and due flashcards to reinforce weak spots.
* **Light social motivation**
  Optional deck sharing, streaks, and class leaderboards that keep study sessions sticky—never spammy.

### For Schools & Programs

* **Teacher-led, bottom-up adoption**
  Teachers can run with it today; admins can standardize later.
* **Privacy-aware by design**
  Per-org and per-class data isolation, private file storage, auditability, and education-friendly defaults.

## Why It’s Different

* **Not another “chat with PDF”**: StudiumHub **structures** content into courses—modules, lessons, and activities—so learning is guided, measurable, and repeatable.
* **Teacher → Class network effect**: One upload equips an entire classroom; students remix and share study sets across cohorts.
* **Scoped AI, not generic answers**: The Tutor is grounded in the current lesson’s chunked sources and cites where facts come from.
* **Analytics that matter**: Confusion hotspots, mastery snapshots, and time-on-task help teachers intervene precisely.

## Example Journeys

**Teacher**

1. Upload Unit 1 slides → auto outline (3 lessons) appears.
2. Skim and edit the generated summaries; tweak a few quiz items.
3. Publish to “Period 3 Biology” and share the link.
4. Check analytics after class: Lesson 2 concepts A & C flagged as confusing → add a short Apply task and a recap deck.

**Student**

1. Open the class link on phone → continue Lesson 1 from last checkpoint.
2. Ask the Tutor “Why is this step valid?” → gets an answer with a page citation.
3. Finish the quiz, miss one, read the explanation.
4. Next day’s review pack includes that concept—and they nail it.
